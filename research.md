# Research Interests

My work is focused around the use of solid-state NMR spectroscopy to understand the local structure and 
dynamics of new fast solid state ionic conductors. NMR is a very powerful tool that can determine the local
environment of a nuclei which cannot be observed by diffraction and infrared techniques as these probe 
average structures.

Through the use of NMR at low and high field (at the [UK 850 MHz national NMR Facility](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/condensedmatt/nmr/850/))
we can determine the local environments of various nuclei. Variable temperature NMR is used to study the 
ion dynamics of the probed nuclei through the observation of change in static NMR linewidth and 
spin-lattice relaxation rates. NMR is used in combination with diffraction techniques and DFT based 
calculations to determine structure, and in combination with impedance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics 
simulation for dynamics investigation.
